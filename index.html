   <h1>Thypography with food</h1> 
   <div id="text1">Food is essential for human survival, providing the nutrients and energy needed to maintain health, growth, and bodily functions. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of key information about food:</div>
<div id="text2">1. Nutrients in Food
    Carbohydrates: A primary source of energy found in foods like grains, fruits, vegetables, and legumes. Simple carbs provide quick energy, while complex carbs offer longer-lasting fuel.
    Proteins: Important for growth, tissue repair, and immune function. Protein sources include meat, fish, eggs, dairy, beans, and nuts.</div>
<div id="text3">Fruits and Vegetables: Rich in vitamins, minerals, fiber, and antioxidants. A diet high in fruits and vegetables can reduce the risk of chronic diseases like heart disease and cancer.
    Grains: Foods like rice, wheat, oats, and barley are rich in carbohydrates and fiber. Whole grains are healthier because they contain more nutrients and fiber than refined grains.
    Proteins: Meat, poultry, fish, eggs, beans, and plant-based proteins like tofu and tempeh provide essential amino acids, the building blocks of proteins.</div>
<p id="p1">Nutrients: Carbs (energy), proteins (growth/repair), fats (brain/energy), vitamins/minerals (body functions), and water (hydration).
    Categories: Fruits/veggies (nutrients), grains (energy), proteins (meat/beans), dairy (bone health), fats/oils (healthy fats are key).
    Health: A balanced diet from all groups supports overall health and prevents diseases.
    </p>

        Balanced Diet: A mix of all food groups ensures good health and reduces disease
